        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Rovin "RJ" Nalica grew up in a small town, where life moved as slowly as the mornings without coffee.
        Raised by his grandmother, a humble baker known for her ube pandesal and warm hugs, RJ learned early
        on that food and drink weren’t just sustenance—they were love, shared one bite and sip at a time.

        After losing his grandmother, RJ found himself holding on to her recipe book and the memory of her saying,
        "Good food brings people together, but great coffee keeps them there." Inspired by her words, he left his
        corporate job to chase a dream: creating a space where people could find comfort, connection, and, of course,
        the perfect brew.
            
        CozyCup Café was born from that dream—a cozy haven filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, homemade
        treats, and laughter. Every cup served carries a bit of his grandmother's legacy, reminding everyone who walks
        through the door that sometimes, the simplest things—a warm drink and a kind smile—can change your day.</p>
